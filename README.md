# doopley
Just a game where random stuff happens, I got bored idk.

The code in this repo is not really representative of how I code in Roblox, since this wasnt a serious game and only made in ~1 day,
so I didn't really consider organization or preformance a priority.

Repo meant as an archive, not being activley developed.
